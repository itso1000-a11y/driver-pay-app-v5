## v5.2.3 — Day Off Context Polish

- Day Off now keeps the existing Rest Card visible.
- Day Off hides the unused Kilometres / Start km block.
- Day Off hides Day Summary and shows compact Current Week context instead.
- No changes to Pay Profiles, Pay Setup, pay calculation, Weekly Rest Engine, or Rest Card logic.

## v5.2.2 – Version single-source sync

- Added package.json-driven version sync via scripts/sync-version.mjs.
- App UI version, HTML title, manifest and service-worker cache now update from one source before build.
- No pay, profile, rest, weekly rest or layout logic changes.


## v5.2.2 – Weekly Rest Visual / Start Validation Fix
- Weekly Rest preview card now uses existing app colours: standard dark main time, grey source helper, existing helper warning/success colours.
- Added Start field violation validator: if entered Start is before the earliest legal rest boundary, the Start field turns red and shows “Rest not completed”.
- Legal entered Start values remain visually standard. Rest Card logic is not changed by this UX validator.
