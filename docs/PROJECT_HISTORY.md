## REST-9H-HELPER — accepted behaviour restored

Decision:
- Start field uses the 11h normal-rest suggestion as the main suggested start time.
- 9h reduced-rest is shown as a small helper/boundary below the field when reduced rest is available.
- The 9h helper should not be hidden only because the boundary was reached on the previous calendar day.

Reason:
The app is not a live tachograph logger. A driver may start work first and enter the Start time later.

Boundary:
- The 72h weekly/long-rest helper handling is separate and is not changed by this patch.
